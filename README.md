1. Traditional Spring Boot Architecture:
Overview:
Often monolithic and tightly coupled.
The application directly interacts with external dependencies (e.g., databases, messaging systems) through service or repository layers.
Layers include Controller → Service → Repository → Database.
Not inherently designed for flexibility or easy replacement of external systems.

Characteristics:
Layered Structure: Follows a layered architecture with a fixed flow of control.
Tight Coupling: Business logic depends directly on frameworks, repositories, and infrastructure details.
Testing Challenges: Testing requires mocking several layers due to tight coupling.
Change Impact: Changes in external systems (e.g., a database schema) can ripple through the application, requiring multiple modifications.

2. Hexagonal Architecture:
Overview:
Emphasizes loose coupling and modularity.
Centralizes business logic in the core, isolating it from external dependencies like databases, APIs, or user interfaces.
Introduces Ports (interfaces) and Adapters (implementations) to abstract the core from infrastructure and frameworks.

Characteristics:
Core Domain Logic: Business logic resides in the central application core, independent of frameworks or tools.
Ports and Adapters:
Ports define interfaces for communication with the core.
Adapters implement these interfaces to integrate with external systems.
Flexibility: Replacing an adapter (e.g., switch databases) is straightforward.
Testability: Core logic can be tested independently without external dependencies.
Separation of Concerns: Strong emphasis on isolating concerns (e.g., UI, data persistence, business logic).


When to Choose Hexagonal Architecture in Spring Boot:
If you need to design for scalability and extensibility.
When you want to make the business logic framework-agnostic.
To improve testability by decoupling the core domain.
